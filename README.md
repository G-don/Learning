##Learning

These notes will keep track of my ongoing projects and the technologies I plan to learn next!

##Current Projects

Currently, I'm taking my first steps in React and learning the basics. I already experienced a bit of Redux as well. This week I will start something new with React. 
I'm doing a Spring Rest API. 


##Next Projects

My next project is called "GINO". This game will demonstrate my creativity in game development and the ability to create fun, addictive games.
Additionally, I plan to develop a portfolio website using a new technology. This project will showcase my ability to adapt to new technologies and create visually stunning websites that are user-friendly.

##Technologies to Learn

To keep up with the latest technologies and stay competitive in the job market, I plan to learn React and Python. React is a popular library for building user interfaces and can be used to create modern, dynamic web applications. Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of projects, from data analysis to machine learning.

##COMING SOON

My first React Project!
My JS game!

With these projects and technologies, I'm excited to continue growing my skills and exploring new opportunities. And Python shall be next!!!
