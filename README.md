##Learning

These notes will keep track of my ongoing projects and the technologies I plan to learn next!

##Current Projects

Currently, I'm working on completing a single-page application (SPA) that revolves around cocktails. This project will showcase my skills in building web applications and creating engaging user experiences.

##Next Projects

My next project is called "GINO". This game will demonstrate my creativity in game development and the ability to create fun, addictive games.
Additionally, I plan to develop a portfolio website using a new technology. This project will showcase my ability to adapt to new technologies and create visually stunning websites that are user-friendly.
Technologies to Learn

To keep up with the latest technologies and stay competitive in the job market, I plan to learn React and Python. React is a popular library for building user interfaces and can be used to create modern, dynamic web applications. Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of projects, from data analysis to machine learning.

##COMING SOON

Stay tuned for the release of "Kock Tail's" â€“ an upcoming video tutorial series where your bartender Tone Cruze will share multiple recipes for your favorite spirits. Follow his instructions to create the best cocktail! This project will showcase my communication skills and my ability to work on a variety of projects.

With these projects and technologies, I'm excited to continue growing my skills and exploring new opportunities.
